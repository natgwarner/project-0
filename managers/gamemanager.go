and you quickly turn tail and run as she draws her pistol. She fires at you as you run out the door but misses, and you quickly sprint back out where 
you came from as the others in the hideout looked on in confusion. You hear Ava scream orders to hunt you down as you began to hear a thunder of footsteps 
chasing after you down the waterways. You were letting your adrenaline carry you as you barreled down the sewers with reckless abandon, desperate to get 
away from your pursuers as quickly as possible. You scanned the sewers for any semblance of a hiding place, but it was proving difficult. You knew you 
had to keep moving no matter the cost, but you were beginning to get tired. A hiding place might save you -- you just had to find one first. You...`+"\n",
